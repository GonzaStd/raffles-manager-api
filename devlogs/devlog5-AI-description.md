## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Revolution

### Before: Simple Auto-increment IDs
The original system used simple global auto-increment primary keys:
- `buyers.id` ‚Üí Global sequence
- `projects.id` ‚Üí Global sequence  
- `raffle_sets.id` ‚Üí Global sequence
- `raffles.number` ‚Üí Global sequence

### After: Composite Primary Keys with User Scoping
Complete restructure to composite primary keys with user isolation:

```sql
-- Users table (unchanged base structure)
users(id, username, hashed_password, is_active, created_at, updated_at)

-- Buyers: Per-user numbering
buyers(user_id, buyer_number, name, phone, email, created_at, updated_at)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, buyer_number)

-- Projects: Per-user numbering
projects(user_id, project_number, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, project_number)

-- Raffle Sets: Per-project numbering
raffle_sets(user_id, project_number, set_number, name, type, init, final, unit_price, created_at, updated_at)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, project_number, set_number)

-- Raffles: Per-project numbering
raffles(user_id, project_number, raffle_number, set_number, buyer_user_id, buyer_number, payment_method, state, created_at, updated_at)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, project_number, raffle_number)
```

### Key Benefits
- **User Privacy**: No information leakage about system usage
- **Predictable URLs**: `/buyer/1` always refers to user's first buyer
- **Data Isolation**: Perfect separation between users
- **Intuitive Numbering**: Each user sees entities numbered from 1

## üîë Composite Primary Keys Implementation

### Universal Auto-increment System
Created a sophisticated auto-increment system that works across all models:

```python
def get_next_number(db: Session, Model, user_id: int, filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> int:
    """
    Universal auto-increment function for any model with composite PKs.
    
    Args:
        db: Database session
        Model: SQLAlchemy model class
        user_id: User ID for filtering
        filters: Additional filters for scoping (e.g., {'project_number': 1})
    
    Returns:
        Next available number for the specified scope
    """
```

### Specialized Functions
- `get_next_buyer_number(db, user_id)` ‚Üí Per-user buyer numbering
- `get_next_project_number(db, user_id)` ‚Üí Per-user project numbering  
- `get_next_set_number(db, user_id, project_number)` ‚Üí Per-project set numbering
- `get_next_raffle_number(db, user_id, project_number)` ‚Üí Per-project raffle numbering

### Hierarchical URL Structure
The new API reflects the data hierarchy:

```
# User-scoped entities
GET /buyer/{buyer_number}
GET /project/{project_number}

# Project-scoped entities  
GET /project/{project_number}/raffleset/{set_number}
GET /project/{project_number}/raffle/{raffle_number}
POST /project/{project_number}/raffles  # Filtered search
```

## üë• User Isolation and Multi-tenancy

### Complete User Scoping
Every entity is now scoped to a user, creating perfect isolation:

- Users can only see/modify their own data
- Numbering sequences are independent per user
- No cross-user data contamination possible
- Horizontal scaling ready

### Security Enhancements
- **No ID enumeration attacks**: User can't guess other users' IDs
- **Information hiding**: System usage patterns hidden
- **Access control**: Built into the data model level

### Multi-tenant Architecture Benefits
- Each user effectively has their own "database view"
- Easy to implement user-based quotas/limits
- Prepared for future horizontal partitioning
- Clean audit trails per user

## üõ†Ô∏è Universal Helper Functions

### CRUD Operations Revolution
Replaced model-specific CRUD with universal functions:

```python
# Universal record retrieval by composite key
def get_record_by_composite_key(db: Session, Model, user_id: int, **kwargs)

# Universal filtered record listing  
def get_records_filtered(db: Session, Model, user_id: int, filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
                        limit: int = 0, offset: int = 0)

# Universal record creation
def create_record(db: Session, new_record)

# Universal record updates
def update_record_by_composite_key(db: Session, Model, user_id: int, updates: Dict[str, Any], **pk_fields)

# Universal record deletion
def delete_record(db: Session, record, user_id: int)
```

### Benefits of Universal Functions
- **Code reuse**: Same logic across all models
- **Consistency**: Identical behavior patterns
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for CRUD operations
- **Error handling**: Centralized exception management

## üîç Enhanced Filtering and Sorting

### Advanced Raffle Filtering
Implemented sophisticated filtering for raffle management:

```python
@router.post("/project/{project_number}/raffles", response_model=List[RaffleDetailedResponse])
def get_raffles_filtered(
    project_number: int,
    filters: RaffleFilters,
    limit: int = 0,
    offset: int = 0,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """Get raffles with advanced filtering for raffle management and drawing"""
```

### Filter Options
- **By state**: `available`, `sold`, `reserved`
- **By set**: Specific raffle set within project
- **By buyer**: Raffles purchased by specific buyer
- **By payment method**: `cash`, `card`, `transfer`
- **Pagination**: Limit and offset support

### Sorting Intelligence
Automatic intelligent sorting based on model type:
- **Buyers**: Sorted by `buyer_number`
- **Projects**: Sorted by `project_number`
- **Raffle Sets**: Sorted by `project_number`, `set_number`
- **Raffles**: Sorted by `project_number`, `raffle_number`

### Use Cases Enabled
- **Raffle Drawing**: Easy to get all available raffles for random selection
- **Sales Reports**: Filter by payment method and date ranges
- **Buyer Management**: See all raffles purchased by a specific buyer
- **Set Analysis**: Analyze sales within specific raffle sets

## üîí Authentication and Security Improvements

### Enhanced User Registration
Improved registration with better error handling and security:

```python
@router.post("/register", response_model=dict)
def register_user(user_data: UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """
    Secure user registration.
    Only gives generic response to prevent user enumeration.
    Real errors are reported specifically.
    """
```

### Security Features
- **User enumeration prevention**: Generic responses for existing users
- **Detailed error logging**: Internal logs for administrators
- **Password hashing**: Secure bcrypt implementation
- **JWT tokens**: Proper token expiration and validation

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: Creates user with hashed password
2. **Login**: Validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. **Protected routes**: All CRUD operations require valid JWT
4. **User context**: Current user automatically injected into all operations

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Initialization System

### Intelligent Database Setup
Implemented robust database initialization:

```python
def create_database_if_not_exists():
    """Create the database if it doesn't exist"""
    
def create_tables_sqlalchemy():
    """Create tables using SQLAlchemy"""
    
def create_tables_sql():
    """Create tables using SQL file as fallback"""
```

### Multi-environment Support
- **Railway**: Automatic detection of cloud database
- **Local development**: MariaDB/MySQL setup with database creation
- **Fallback mechanisms**: SQL file backup if SQLAlchemy fails

### Startup Integration
Application automatically initializes database on startup:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    """Initialize database on startup"""
    try:
        from database import initialize_database
        initialize_database()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Database initialization failed: {e}")
    
    yield  # App runs here
```

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### SQLAlchemy Relationship Conflicts
**Problem**: Overlapping foreign key relationships causing model initialization failures.

**Solution**: Added proper `overlaps` parameters to all model relationships:

```python
# User model relationships
raffle_sets = relationship("RaffleSet", back_populates="user", overlaps="projects")
raffles = relationship("Raffle", back_populates="user", overlaps="projects,raffle_sets")

# RaffleSet model relationships  
user = relationship("User", back_populates="raffle_sets", overlaps="project")
raffles = relationship("Raffle", back_populates="raffle_set", overlaps="user")
```

### Bcrypt Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Newer bcrypt versions incompatible with passlib.

**Solution**: Pinned bcrypt to version 4.0.1 for compatibility.

### JWT Token Issues
**Problem**: Token creation failing due to timezone issues.

**Solution**: Switched to `datetime.utcnow()` for consistent UTC timestamps.

### Database Connection Handling
**Problem**: Connection failures not properly handled.

**Solution**: Added connection testing and retry mechanisms.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Database Query Optimization
- **Composite indexes**: Proper indexing on composite primary keys
- **Filtered queries**: Reduced data transfer with smart filtering
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Query pagination**: Large dataset handling with limit/offset

### Memory Usage
- **Lazy loading**: Relationships loaded on demand
