# Latest Fixes and Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the latest critical fixes applied to resolve SQLAlchemy relationship conflicts and registration failures that were occurring in production.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. SQLAlchemy Relationship Conflicts

**Problem**: The application was experiencing SQLAlchemy warnings and initialization failures due to overlapping foreign key relationships between models. This was causing the User model's `hashed_password` field to not be recognized properly, resulting in registration failures with the error:

```
'hashed_password' is an invalid keyword argument for User
```

**Root Cause**: Multiple relationships were copying the same foreign key columns without proper overlap declarations, causing SQLAlchemy to be unable to determine the correct relationship mappings.

**Solution**: Added proper `overlaps` parameters to all model relationships:

- **User Model**: Added overlaps for `raffle_sets` and `raffles` relationships
- **Project Model**: Added overlaps for `raffle_sets` relationship  
- **RaffleSet Model**: Fixed overlaps between `user`, `project`, and `raffles` relationships
- **Raffle Model**: Fixed overlaps between `user` and `raffle_set` relationships

### 2. Database Initialization Issues

**Problem**: The application wasn't properly initializing the database and tables on startup, leading to runtime errors when the database didn't exist.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `main.py` to use modern FastAPI lifespan events
- Added automatic database and table creation on application startup
- Implemented proper error handling for database initialization failures

### 3. Bcrypt Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: Newer versions of bcrypt (4.3.0) were causing compatibility issues with the passlib library.

**Solution**: Downgraded bcrypt to version 4.0.1 which maintains compatibility with passlib.

## Technical Details

### SQLAlchemy Relationship Fixes

The core issue was that SQLAlchemy couldn't properly map relationships when multiple models had foreign keys pointing to the same columns. For example:

- `RaffleSet.user_id` → `users.id`
- `Project.user_id` → `users.id` 
- `RaffleSet.user_id` → `projects.user_id` (composite FK)

This created ambiguity that SQLAlchemy couldn't resolve automatically. The solution was to explicitly declare which relationships overlap:

```python
# In User model
raffle_sets = relationship("RaffleSet", back_populates="user", overlaps="projects")
raffles = relationship("Raffle", back_populates="user", overlaps="projects,raffle_sets")

# In RaffleSet model  
user = relationship("User", back_populates="raffle_sets", overlaps="project")
raffles = relationship("Raffle", back_populates="raffle_set", overlaps="user")
```

### Database Initialization Improvements

Implemented modern FastAPI lifespan management:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    """Initialize database on startup"""
    try:
        from database import initialize_database
        initialize_database()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Database initialization failed: {e}")
    
    yield  # App runs here
    
    print("Application shutting down")
```

## Impact

### Before Fixes
- Registration endpoint returning 500 errors
- SQLAlchemy warnings flooding logs
- Inconsistent database initialization
- Production deployment failures

### After Fixes  
- Clean user registration working correctly
- No SQLAlchemy warnings
- Reliable database initialization on startup
- Stable production deployments

## Testing

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Registration Test**:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://raffles-manager-api-production.up.railway.app/auth/register' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpass"}'
```

2. **Database Initialization Test**:
   - Delete the database
   - Restart the application
   - Verify tables are created automatically

3. **Model Relationship Test**:
   - Create users, projects, raffle sets, and raffles
   - Verify all relationships work correctly
   - Check that no SQLAlchemy warnings appear in logs

## Deployment Notes

These fixes are critical for production stability and should be deployed immediately. The changes are backward compatible and don't require database migrations since they only affect SQLAlchemy model definitions and application startup behavior.

## Future Considerations

- Monitor production logs for any remaining SQLAlchemy warnings
- Consider implementing database health checks in the `/health` endpoint
- Add automated tests for model relationship integrity
- Implement database connection pooling optimizations if needed

*These fixes ensure the application has a solid foundation for reliable user registration and database operations.*
